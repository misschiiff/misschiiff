# 👋 Hi, I'm **BRIDGET IZBA**
###### I have always known that a day would come when i would have to share how my programming journey started and why am so obbessed with coding. the truth is this, it was all meant to be even though i had no plans of being a programmer; infact i was a photographer at the time and my only skill was taking great pictures and editing including designing invitations for events until i stumbled on css in photoshop and i started researching and reading online resources to gain knowledge of programming languages and how to use them to create web pages and the rest is history. 
###### Today i'm a self taught full stack web developer with 25 completed real world web development projects for satisfied clients and 3 personal web development projects with 2 years experience as web developer and 5 years experience as a graphic designer. i spend my free time learning new languages or drawing illustrations and other fun things to kill time and stay productive. i also love the game of chess even though i suck at it today i'm certain it won't remain that way because i have a growth mindset :wink:
